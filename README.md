Introduction
In today's digital age, the demand for intelligent conversational agents has grown significantly
across various industries. Traditional chatbots often struggle with understanding context and
providing relevant responses, leading to frustrating user experiences. This project aimed to address
this challenge by developing context-aware chatbots that could comprehend and respond to
queries more eDectively, leveraging the power of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.
Recognizing the imperative to bridge the gap between user expectations and chatbot capabilities,
our project embarked on a mission to explore the transformative potential of LLMs and RAG
techniques in revolutionizing conversational AI. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, we aimed
to equip chatbots with the cognitive abilities necessary to comprehend context and generate
meaningful responses. Through this endeavor, we aspired to enhance productivity, streamline

Understanding RAG and Large Language Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in natural language processing, driving
innovation across various sectors. These advanced models, trained on vast amounts of text data,
exhibit remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text. The RAG
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model represents a significant advancement in this domain,
combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models. Unlike traditional chatbots,
which rely solely on generative approaches, RAG systems have the ability to incorporate external
knowledge sources, thereby enhancing their contextual understanding and response generation
capabilities. By leveraging this hybrid approach, RAG systems excel at providing more engaging and
informative interactions, elevating the overall user experience.
In addition to their contextual understanding capabilities, RAG systems oDer several advantages
over traditional LLMs. One notable advantage is their ability to access and leverage external
knowledge sources, such as structured databases or unstructured text corpora. This external
knowledge augmentation allows RAG systems to provide more nuanced and accurate responses,
particularly when faced with complex or ambiguous queries. Furthermore, RAG systems are
capable of dynamically adjusting their responses based on the context provided, resulting in more
personalized and relevant interactions with users. Overall, the integration of RAG techniques into
conversational AI represents a significant step forward in improving the eDectiveness and user
satisfaction of chatbot systems.

Cohere's Command R+, Meta AI's LLama-3, and Ollama's Gemma, evaluating their eDicacy in the
context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. This comprehensive exploration
allowed us to harness the collective power of these models, leveraging their advanced
functionalities to create context-aware chatbots capable of addressing diverse user queries with
precision and relevance.

Key Components and Architecture
Both implementations involved several key components, including:
Ø Knowledge Base: A collection of relevant documents or data sources (e.g., PDFs) used as a
foundation for answering queries.
Ø Chunking: Breaking down large input texts into smaller pieces to fit the input size of the
embedding model and improve retrieval eDiciency.
Ø Embeddings Model: Techniques for representing text data as numerical vectors, enabling
eDicient similarity search and retrieval.
Ø Vector Databases: Collections of pre-computed vector representations of text data for fast
retrieval and similarity search.
Ø User Interface: User-friendly interfaces built with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with
the RAG system by providing input queries and receiving responses.
Ø Query Engine: The core component responsible for fetching relevant context, reranking,
and prompting the LLM to generate natural language responses based on the provided
context and query.
Ø Prompt Templates: Custom prompts designed to refine and steer the responses of the
LLM, incorporating the retrieved context and query.
Chatbot Implementation
We utilized the reading assignments from our class, stored as PDF documents, as the foundation of
our database. These documents were subjected to chunking, a process of segmenting large texts
into smaller, more manageable portions. Subsequently, we performed embedding on these
document chunks, transforming textual information into numerical vectors. Leveraging the vector
database, we facilitated swift search query retrieval and captured semantic information crucial for
contextual understanding.
To refine the relevance of search results, we employed a reranker, which prioritized the most
pertinent documents related to the query. These refined results, coupled with a given prompt,
served as inputs to the Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLMs, namely Cohere Command,
Llama-3, and Gemma:2b, were tasked with generating responses based on the provided context
embeddings, thereby enabling context-aware learning through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Additionally, to ensure the seamless integration and eDicient utilization of our LLMs, we
implemented these models using the LLamaindex library. This sophisticated framework served as
the backbone of our system architecture, providing a robust foundation for context-aware learning,
and enhancing the performance of our LLMs. By leveraging the capabilities of LLamaindex, we
optimized the retrieval and utilization of context embeddings, thereby maximizing the eDectiveness
and responsiveness of our conversational AI system.
Example prompt given to answer our queries
For user interaction, we developed a chat interface using the Panel library. This interface allowed
users to input queries along with relevant file content. Subsequently, responses were generated by
the three LLMs, with outputs demonstrating a high level of comprehensiveness and alignment with
the given prompt. The implementation of these models was facilitated using the LLamaindex
library, streamlining the process of context-aware learning and enhancing the performance of the
LLMs.
The project explored two diDerent approaches to implementing RAG-based chatbots:
Ø Employed a two-model architecture, with one model for user-chatbot interaction and
another for chatbot-chatbot interaction. In user-chatbot scenarios, the chatbot responds
directly to user queries based on input. Conversely, in chatbot-chatbot interactions, the
second bot enhances or rectifies responses generated by the first bot, leveraging its shared
training data. This innovative approach ensures more accurate and refined responses
across various interaction types, enhancing overall user experience and conversational
depth.
Ø Incorporated Cohere's embedding model (embed-english-v3.0) and reranker for eDicient
retrieval and ranking of relevant context.

Challenges and Limitations
The project faced several limitations and challenges, including:
Ø Limited Knowledge Base: The restricted range of data limited the chatbots' ability to
answer diverse questions.
Ø Contextual Understanding: The chatbots had less sophisticated mechanisms for
deciphering complex queries and following extended conversations.
Ø Learning Capability: The machine learning implementations were more basic, leading to
slower improvement and adaptation over time.
Ø Technical Constraints: Potential issues with scalability and handling high traDic aDected
the system's performance under load.
Ø User Experience: The simpler interfaces may have lacked some advanced features
expected from cutting-edge chatbots.
These limitations stemmed from factors such as the complexity of queries, resource constraints,
and the challenges of implementing more advanced NLP algorithms and adaptive learning
mechanisms.
